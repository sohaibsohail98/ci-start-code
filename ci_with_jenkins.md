## CI with Jenkins

- SLDC - Software Development Lifecycle
Development - testing - release 

This has been a slow process for a long time, hence there is a CI and CD process implemented. 

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

This allows the integration errors to be resolved faster and there is easier backtracing, to eliminate issues. 

The way continuous integration is practiced, there is a specific branch allocated to each developer. After each tests occur, each developer pushes its changes to that branch. Once everything is fully tested and completed, it's integrated together.

Continuous Delivery is the process of automating code changes in real-time. It’s the concept of deploying software more frequently through push sequences. It’s also running automated tests on newly published code/software to detect problems.
